==game desighn ideas==
* [ ] make all characters bound to the ground (no jumps, leaps into the air, etc)
* [ ] make all autoattacks mele
* [ ] there is one map that is mostly flat
* [ ] The game is taking place in a heaven colosseum of sorts, the characters are bound to the ground by demonic hands
	  that constantly move. The one who loses is taken down by these hands to hell or alternative. The one who wins is 
	  unbound and assends into the air
* [ ] We balance it by adding abilities to control space to the characters, and make them high skill expressive
